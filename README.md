# Content Management System

## Overview

The Content Management System (CMS) is a full-stack application that allows users to manage their content efficiently. It includes both frontend and backend functionality:

- **Frontend**: Built with React and Material UI (MUI) for a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express, handling API requests to interact with the MongoDB database.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store and manage content data.

This project demonstrates the ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) content, providing a user-friendly interface to manage content data in one centralized system.

## Features
- **Create Content**: Users can create new content by filling out a form.
- **Read Content**: All content can be listed and viewed in a paginated table.
- **Update Content**: Content can be edited and updated.
- **Delete Content**: Content can be deleted from the database.
- **Pagination**: A table view with pagination to display the content in manageable chunks.
- **Material UI**: The UI uses Material UI components for a clean and modern design.
